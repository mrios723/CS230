1. Who was the client and what type of software did they want you to design?
Our client was The Gaming Room, and they came to us wanting a web-based version of their team-based game, Draw It or Lose It. It’s inspired by the old TV show Win, Lose, or Draw, where players guess what’s being drawn. They wanted something fun, accessible across different devices, and designed to support multiple teams playing through several timed rounds.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I did a good job organizing the document and making sure it clearly showed how the system would work. I’m especially proud of the domain model it helped map out how all the pieces like games, teams, and players connect. I also feel that the recommendations section was strong, offering realistic and modern solutions for things like deployment and storage using tools like AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes.

3. What part of the design document process helped you most when coding?
Working through the design document really helped me stay focused. It forced me to think through the structure before jumping into code, which saved a lot of time later. Defining requirements and constraints early made it easier to write code that was clean and aligned with what the client wanted. It was also helpful for planning how different parts of the software would talk to each other.

4. If you could revise one part of the document, what would you improve?
I’d definitely spend more time on the evaluation section. Some parts, like Linux and server-side tools, were well explained, but others especially mobile platforms could’ve used more detail. I’d want to make sure each platform was evaluated with the same depth, so the client could make fully informed decisions about where and how to deploy.

5. How did you interpret and incorporate the user’s needs? Why is that important?
I tried to keep the user in mind every step of the way. They wanted something easy to access, fun to play, and fair for everyone. That’s why I focused on features like a smooth web experience, unique names to avoid confusion, and giving all teams a chance to guess during each round. Listening to user needs is crucial if you build something that doesn’t work for real people, then what’s the point? The user experience really makes or breaks a product.

6. How did you approach designing the software? What would you do again in the future?
I took an object-oriented approach and relied on tools like UML diagrams to get a clear picture of the system structure. Breaking things down into manageable services helped me think through the flow and responsibilities of each part. In the future, I’d keep doing that but I’d also bring in more user feedback early on, maybe through quick mockups or prototypes, just to make sure everything is headed in the right direction before diving into the build.
